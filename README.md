ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

This is a ESP script with a custom GUI designed specifically for Valley Prison on Roblox. The script is obfuscated to make it more resistant to detection and patching by the gameâ€™s developers.

Want to load in your executor? Execute this: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infyiff/backup/main/dex.lua"))()

ðŸ”§ Features:

Adjustable ESP label size via buttons

Accurate team-based color coordination

Real-time distance display in studs

Visible name tags for all players

Unique color for the Director (optimized for use with my DKG script)

This ESP includes everything you need for a smooth and informative in-game experience.
