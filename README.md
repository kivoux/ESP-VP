Greetings!

This is a full-blown ESP script with a GUI for Valley Prison. The code is obufusacated so that the developers of VP will have a harder time patching such script. 
If the developers would ever so kindly reach out to me about appealing my false ban due to hearsay I'll gladly remove the script, but for now it is staying up! 
I'd gladly assist them in the creation of an ANTI-CHEAT in their game, but they don't want to do such.


FEATURES: 

- Adjustable ESP label sizing
- Proper colour coordinating for each team

Pretty much all the features you need.



ISSUES:
Due to limited time I cared to create this, it doesn't always update whoever spawns in so just re-enabled it every so often. 
Maybe I'll fix it and add more features if the VP devs get on my nerves again.
